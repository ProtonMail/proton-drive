# [4.0.0-beta.3] - 2020-11-11 

We have been working on adding new functionality to ProtonDrive, as well as listening to your feedback to address frictions you've been having.

We resolved large file uploading errors by curing the memory leaks, and before uploading hundreds of files, user will get a warning message. This is to improve the uploading files experience, but it does not stop here, as we will continue iterating and building better product going forward.

Thank you for your feedback and time with us.
