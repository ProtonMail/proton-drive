# [4.1.0] - 2020-09-29

​Here at Proton we value your support and staying with us over the years. As a token of gratitude, and unveiling our future plans, we give you early access to ProtonDrive Beta. ​

With ProtonDrive, you can upload and manage your files, keep your files secure and access them from anywhere. ​

ProtonDrive has been hand crafted by using end-to-end and zero-access encryption technologies, so no one can read your data. Not even us.

Welcome to ProtonDrive Beta. ​
